## Problem Statement

Physical fitness is the key concern of todayâ€™s generation. It is the state of well-being and the ability to perform aspects of sports and daily activities. One can be physically fit when he/she is mentally fit. Thus the common mass also demands products that will help in maintaining and tracking their physical/mental fitness. In today's busy and competitive world, most employees tend to be mentally stressed out. Thus a system has to be made which helps in reducing the mental stress so that a person can be physically as well as mentally fit.
